# Country-Socioeconomic-Aid-Lab
#### Context
HELP International is an international humanitarian Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) that is committed to fighting poverty and providing the people of backward countries with basic amenities and relief during the time of disasters and natural calamities.

HELP International have been able to raise around $10 million. Now HELP international needs to decide how to use this money strategically and effectively. Hence, our job is to categorize the countries using some socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country. Then we can suggest the countries which HELP needs to focus on the most.
